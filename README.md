# Route360

Route360 is an app designed to generate a running route of a specified distance using either your current location or a desired starting location. This section will be broken into categories by functionality. We will work our way from left to right across the UI.

1. Generate Running Route from Current Location:
    a. Select the location arrow in the top left of the UI.
    b. Enter a distance (in miles) that you would like to run (decimals can be used as well).
    c. Select "Done".
        i. The app will then generate a running loop of a specified distance.
        ii. You may need to zoom out to see the entire route (in the simulator use the option key to facilitate zooming).
    d. The app will also drop a pin at your current location so that you know where you started.
    
    
2. Generate Running Route from Other Location:
    a. Select the search bar at the top center of the UI.
    b. Search for a location where you would like to start.
        i. The suggested results are based on the field of view displayed on the map. Zoom in for more accuracy.
        ii. Note the addresses listed under items to ensure you find the correct location.
    c. Select a location in the list.
    d. Now enter a distance (in miles) that you would like to run (decimals can be used as well).
    e. Select "Done".
        i. The app will then generate a running loop of a specified distance.
        ii. You may need to zoom out to see the entire route (in the simulator use the option key to facilitate zooming).
    f. The app will also drop a pin at the starting location so that you know where to start.
